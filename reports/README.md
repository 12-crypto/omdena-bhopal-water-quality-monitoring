## Introduction

The primary objective of this challenge is to find effective ways to monitor water quality in the Bhopal region using satellite imagery. The purpose of this project is to reduce the cost of the monitoring process, as the current method utilizing IoT sensors requires a significant amount of maintenance, making it an expensive process. The main goal of the project is to identify parameters that can be used to monitor water quality, establish a standardized way of collecting real-time data, identify any discrepancies in the current monitoring process, and improve them as much as possible. To achieve these objectives, a detailed data analysis will be conducted. We will examine a range of satellite imagery data and extract the relevant parameters that can be used to monitor water quality. By analyzing this data, we will be able to identify patterns and trends that can be used to improve the monitoring process. Finally, we will develop a visualization dashboard using either Tableau or Power BI to present the collected data in a user-friendly and visually appealing manner. The dashboard will provide key metrics and insights related to water quality in the region, allowing for easy monitoring and informed decision-making based on the data collected.

The challenge, which united an international team of AI engineers over 5 weeks, was led by [Vaasu Bisht](https://github.com/vaasu2002) and [Eeman Majumder](https://github.com/Eeman1113). The common language for the chapter was English. Platforms such as GitHub, Notion, Asana, and a dedicated Slack channed were used to coordinate and keep track of the engineer's work.
